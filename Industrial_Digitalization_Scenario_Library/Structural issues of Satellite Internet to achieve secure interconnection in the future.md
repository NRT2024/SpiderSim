### Structural issues of Satellite Internet to achieve secure interconnection in the future

#### 1. Domain Background

With the rapid development of space internet, it has become a key direction for the next-generation global internet and the focal point of international space competition. As the core component of space internet, satellite internet offers advantages such as global coverage, low latency, and high bandwidth, providing stable internet connections in areas where terrestrial networks are difficult to reach. However, as technology advances and applications proliferate, the issue of secure interconnection and interoperability in satellite internet is becoming increasingly evident. Particularly in cross-national, cross-platform, and cross-industry cooperation, ensuring secure and reliable connections between different satellite internet systems has become a significant challenge.

#### 2. Problem Analysis

Interconnection and interoperability in satellite internet refer to the seamless integration of different satellite networks, ensuring smooth and secure data transfer from one system to another. However, due to the involvement of multiple countries and different technological platforms, there are variations in protocols, encryption methods, and authentication mechanisms between satellite networks, which pose significant security risks. For example, differences in protocols, technical barriers, and security vulnerabilities can lead to data leakage, tampering, or forgery during transmission, potentially even affecting the normal operation of satellites. Achieving secure interconnection and interoperability on a global scale requires international cooperation and technological coordination, which brings about considerable complexity and difficulty.

#### 3. Scene Introduction

To achieve secure interconnection and interoperability in satellite internet, a unified security framework needs to be established. Firstly, countries and satellite operators should enhance coordination in technical standards and protocols to avoid security risks arising from technological differences. Secondly, a comprehensive encryption and authentication system needs to be built to ensure the security of data during cross-network transmission. Furthermore, countries should cooperate through intergovernmental agreements to standardize regulatory measures and security requirements, ensuring the unity and synergy of global satellite internet. In practice, satellite internet not only needs to interface with terrestrial networks but also requires collaboration with other satellite networks to share resources, thus promoting the secure and stable development of global internet interconnection.

#### 4. Scene Target

The main goal of satellite internet is to achieve secure interconnection and interoperability on a global scale, ensuring secure and reliable data transmission between different satellite systems. Specifically, the goal is to enable interoperability between different satellite internet systems through standardized protocols, encryption technologies, and identity authentication mechanisms. Additionally, the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data transmission must be ensured to prevent data leakage or tampering, thus protecting user and national security.

#### 5. Scenario Elements

To achieve secure interconnection and interoperability in satellite internet, compatibility issues between different satellite networks need to be addressed at the technical level. For example, standardized communication protocols should be adopted to ensure data consistency across networks. In terms of security, a globally applicable encryption technology and identity verification mechanism should be designed and promoted to safeguard communication security across countries and platforms. Furthermore, intergovernmental cooperation mechanisms should be established to jointly address satellite internet security risks, ensuring a balance between technological upgrades and security needs. By integrating these measures, a safer, more stable, and efficient global satellite internet system can be built.
