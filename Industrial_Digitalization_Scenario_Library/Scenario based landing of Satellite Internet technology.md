### Scenario based landing of Satellite Internet technology

#### 1. Domain Background

With the ongoing evolution and widespread adoption of the big data society, the demand for global information transmission has surged, while spectrum resources are becoming increasingly scarce. Satellite internet, with its unique advantages of broad coverage and low latency, presents a promising solution, particularly in remote areas and specialized scenarios. However, the high construction cost and long return on investment of satellite internet raise significant challenges for its widespread application. The key issue is how to bridge the gap between satellite internet technology and consumers through satellite communication phones and satellite internet terminals.

#### 2. Problem Analysis

Despite the vast market potential of satellite internet, its high construction cost makes it difficult to achieve widespread adoption, especially in consumer-facing markets. Satellite communication phones and terminal devices are still expensive, which limits their acceptance among ordinary users. To achieve the successful integration of satellite internet technology into practical applications, breakthroughs must be made in lowering equipment costs, enhancing user experience, and optimizing business models, so that the technology can be more widely used and meet user needs.

#### 3. Scene Introduction

The successful implementation of satellite internet technology in real-world applications first requires overcoming the issue of device proliferation. For example, research and development of satellite communication phones and terminal devices must focus on reducing production costs and improving the user experience of existing products. Additionally, targeted service products should be developed for specific application scenarios, such as emergency communication, remote healthcare, and smart agriculture. By innovating business models and building strategic partnerships, satellite internet can be integrated with traditional industries, bringing services into the daily lives of consumers.

#### 4. Scene target

The goal of the scene-based application of satellite internet technology is to make satellite internet no longer a high-end technology distant from consumers but one that directly serves the everyday needs of ordinary users. Achieving this goal hinges on reducing costs, improving device performance, and optimizing the user experience, ultimately allowing satellite internet services to be widely adopted worldwide. This will cater to the needs of various industries, especially in regions without terrestrial network coverage, ensuring continuous and reliable service.

#### 5. Scenario Elements

In terms of device design, it is necessary to develop low-cost, high-performance satellite communication phones and terminals to make them accessible to a wider market. The satellite internet system should also further optimize communication efficiency between terminals and satellites to ensure stable connectivity in diverse environments. Moreover, business model innovation is crucial, with opportunities for collaboration with governments, businesses, and other stakeholders to create market-driven solutions. This would enable satellite internet's application in industries such as agriculture, healthcare, and transportation, ultimately leading to its seamless integration into real-world scenarios.
