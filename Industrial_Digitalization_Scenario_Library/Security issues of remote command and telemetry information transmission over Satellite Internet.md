### Security issues of remote command and telemetry information transmission over Satellite Internet

#### 1. Domain Background

With the rapid development of satellite internet, global satellite networks are gradually becoming a reality. To ensure the proper functioning of satellite systems, the transmission of remote control commands and telemetry data between satellites is crucial. However, due to the global and cross-border nature of satellite internet, remote control commands and telemetry data are vulnerable to various security threats, such as interception, tampering, or forgery during transmission. These threats can severely compromise the safe operation of satellites. Ensuring the secure transmission of remote control commands and telemetry information is an important challenge in the information security of satellite internet.

#### 2. Problem Analysis

When satellite internet is deployed globally, remote control commands and telemetry information must be transmitted through inter-satellite links and ground control stations. During this process, the security of data transmission faces multiple threats. Remote control commands can be intercepted or tampered with by malicious attackers, potentially affecting the satellite's operational state or even causing a failure in its control system. Similarly, telemetry data may be altered during transmission, leading to inaccurate operational data and affecting subsequent decision-making. Ensuring that this information remains untampered with and confidential in a complex network environment is a critical issue for the development of satellite internet technology.

#### 3. Scene Introduction

The security of remote control commands and telemetry data transmission in satellite internet relies on multi-layered security mechanisms. For instance, inter-satellite link communication encryption, access control at control stations, and identity authentication technologies used during satellite communication. These technologies help ensure that remote control commands and telemetry data are not tampered with or eavesdropped during transmission. In addition, real-time monitoring systems and intrusion detection mechanisms must be closely integrated with satellite operations to detect and respond to potential security threats promptly.

#### 4. Scene Target

The security goal for satellite internet is to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of remote control commands and telemetry data throughout their transmission process globally. Specifically, encryption, identity authentication, and integrity verification measures should be employed to prevent malicious tampering or forgery of commands and information. Additionally, the system must be highly available, ensuring that even under security attacks, satellite control and telemetry data can still be transmitted securely and reliably, thereby maintaining the normal operation of the satellite internet.

#### 5. Scenario Elements

To ensure the secure transmission of remote control commands and telemetry data, the satellite internet system design should include multiple layers of security. First, inter-satellite link communication should employ strong encryption technologies to protect data from third-party interception. Second, control stations must implement strict identity verification and access control to prevent unauthorized access. Moreover, communication protocols between satellites must have strong tamper-proof capabilities and be able to detect any anomalies in real-time. The satellite internet system should also have a comprehensive emergency response mechanism to address any potential security vulnerabilities or attacks, ensuring the safe and stable operation of satellites.
