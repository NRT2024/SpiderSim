### Integration of Satellite Internet and Internet of things

#### 1. Domain Background

With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, more and more devices and systems across various industries are being connected to the internet, forming an extensive network of devices. Satellite internet, as a communication tool with broad coverage and the ability to overcome geographical limitations, offers new possibilities for the expansion of IoT, particularly in remote areas and oceans where traditional networks are inaccessible. By utilizing satellite internet, IoT devices can transmit data and be controlled more efficiently, providing robust support for the global development of IoT.

#### 2. Problem Analysis

The devices and data involved in IoT are growing exponentially, bringing significant challenges in terms of data processing, storage, transmission, and security. While satellite internet provides global coverage, ensuring efficient network connectivity and low-latency transmission in IoT applications remains a pressing issue. Furthermore, there is a phenomenon of multiple competing communication protocols in the IoT field, such as LoRa and NB-IoT, which adds complexity to selecting the appropriate technology solutions and standards.

#### 3. Scene Introduction

By combining satellite internet with IoT protocols, an efficient and reliable IoT network can be established globally. Satellite internet can provide connectivity to areas that are not covered by terrestrial networks, while IoT devices can choose the appropriate communication protocols for data transmission based on their needs. For example, in fields like agriculture, environmental monitoring, and intelligent transportation, the combination of satellite internet and IoT devices enables real-time data collection, remote monitoring, and intelligent regulation, driving the digital transformation of various industries.

#### 4. Scene Target

The goal of integrating satellite internet with IoT is to provide reliable communication support for devices worldwide, especially in remote, off-grid, or post-disaster recovery environments, ensuring that IoT devices can operate stably. Satellite internet enables IoT devices to connect globally, overcoming geographical barriers, improving data transmission efficiency, reducing latency, and providing stronger support for various application scenarios.

#### 5. Scenario Elements

The system design includes satellite communication infrastructure, IoT terminal devices, data transmission networks, communication protocol layers, and management platforms. The satellite communication network is responsible for providing signal transmission on a global scale, while IoT terminal devices use various communication protocols like LoRa and NB-IoT to enable remote data transmission. The data transmission network ensures the efficient flow of information globally, while the communication protocol layer resolves compatibility issues between different IoT devices. The management platform monitors the operation of the entire system and allocates resources to ensure network stability and security.
