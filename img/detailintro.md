## üìñ **Functional Overview**

### 1. **Evaluating the Effectiveness of Deception-Based Cyber Defense**

#### **Feature Overview**

SpiderSim provides a simulation environment to evaluate the **effectiveness and applicability of deception-based cybersecurity techniques**. This feature allows users to test honeypots, decoys, and **Shock Trap** in a controlled environment and analyze their impact on attacker behavior.

#### **Development Documentation**

Relevant code file: `cyberbattle/samples/toyctf/toy_ctf.py`

In SpiderSim, **honeypot** and **decoy** techniques simulate fake resource nodes to deceive attackers. Below is an example definition of a honeypot:

```
'Honeypot': m.NodeInfo( 
     services=[m.ListeningService("HTTPS")],
     value=-100,  # Negative reward: attackers are penalized for targeting this node
     properties=["GitHub", "SasUrlInCommit"],
     vulnerabilities=dict(
         ScanGitHistory=m.VulnerabilityInfo(
             description="Some secure access token (SAS) leaked in a reverted git commit",
             type=m.VulnerabilityType.REMOTE,
             precondition=m.Precondition('SasUrlInCommit&GitHub'),
             outcome=m.LeakedCredentials(credentials=[
                         m.CachedCredential(node="AzureStorage",
                                                 port="HTTPS",
                                                 credential="SASTOKEN")]),  # Fake credential
             reward_string="CredScan success: Some secure access token (SAS) was leaked in a reverted git commit",
             cost=1.0,
         )
     )
)
```

In this example:

- The **`value`** is set to negative (-100), meaning attackers are penalized for attacking this node.
- A fake key (`SASTOKEN`) is embedded in the honeypot. If attackers use the key to connect to other network nodes, they are further penalized.

**Decoys** are similar to honeypots but are less complex and do not use fake credentials. Here is an example definition of a decoy node:

```
'Decoys': m.NodeInfo( 
     services=[m.ListeningService("HTTPS", allowedCredentials=["SASTOKEN1"])],
     value=-100,
     properties=["CTFFLAG:LeakedData"],
)
```

Additionally, honeypots and decoys can be referenced in the **`Website`** node, as shown below:

```
IntoHoneypot = m.VulnerabilityInfo(
     description="This is a fake vulnerability connecting to Honeypot",
     type=m.VulnerabilityType.REMOTE,
     outcome=m.LeakedNodesId(["Honeypot"]),
     reward_string="welcome to Honeypot",
     cost=1.0
 )

IntoDecoys = m.VulnerabilityInfo(
     description="This is a fake vulnerability connecting to Decoys",
     type=m.VulnerabilityType.REMOTE,
     outcome=m.LeakedNodesId(["SASTOKEN1"]),
     reward_string="welcome to Decoys",
     cost=1.0
 )
```

These definitions deploy honeypots and decoys on a `Website` node, simulating fake resources attackers might target.

In contrast, **Shock Trap** is designed to act as a deceptive trap triggered by vulnerabilities. It blocks subsequent attack paths and penalizes attackers. Below is an example definition:

```
'Servers': m.NodeInfo(
    services=[m.ListeningService("SSH", allowedCredentials=["ServersCredential"])],
    value=-100,
)
```

In this definition:

- Attackers attempting to connect to this node are penalized and denied further access.

Using the `toy_ctf.py` file, you can simulate a variety of deception-based defense techniques, including honeypots, decoys, and Shock Trap.

#### Instantiate the Gym Environment

First, create a new file `cyberbattle_toyctf.py` in the `cyberbattle/_env` directory and add the following code:

```python
from ..samples.toyctf import toy_ctf
from . import cyberbattle_env

class CyberBattleToyCtf(cyberbattle_env.CyberBattleEnv):
    """CyberBattle simulation based on a toy CTF exercise"""

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(
            initial_environment=toy_ctf.new_environment(),
            **kwargs)
```

Next, add the following code snippet to the `cyberbattle/__init__.py` file:

```python
if 'CyberBattleToyCtf-v0' in registry.env_specs:
    del registry.env_specs['CyberBattleToyCtf-v0']

register(
    id='CyberBattleToyCtf-v0',
    cyberbattle_env_identifiers=toy_ctf.ENV_IDENTIFIERS,
    entry_point='cyberbattle._env.cyberbattle_toyctf:CyberBattleToyCtf',
    kwargs={'defender_agent': None,
            'attacker_goal': AttackerGoal(own_atleast=6),
            'defender_goal': DefenderGoal(eviction=True)
            },
    # max_episode_steps=2600,
)
```

#### **Reproducing Results**

After defining the defense techniques, run the following Jupyter Notebook to reproduce the relevant experimental results:

```
notebooks/notebook_benchmark-toyctf.ipynb
```

This script will help you replicate the results published in the [paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-56583-0_15) and validate the effectiveness of deception-based defense techniques.

### 2. **Simulating Industrial Digitalization Scenarios**

#### **Feature Overview**

SpiderSim enables **theoretical simulations of industrial digitalization scenarios**, allowing users to generate theoretical-Level simulation environments and analyze their cybersecurity.

#### **Code Example**

For instance, SpiderSim provides a simulation of the **Smart Ocean** scenario. Relevant code can be found here: `cyberbattle/samples/toyctf/smart_sea.py`.

#### **Steps to Run the Simulation**

1. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```
   notebooks/toyctf-random.ipynb
   ```

2. In the notebook, create a `gym` environment and specify the industrial digitalization scenario:

   ```
   gym_env = gym.make('CyberBattleSea-v0')
   ```

3. Set the `gym_env` parameter to `'CyberBattleSea-v0'` and execute the notebook to build the scenario.

NoteÔºöThe Gym environment instantiation for the Smart Ocean scene has already been completed in the project. For detailed code, refer to `cyberbattle/_env/cyberbattle_smartsea.py` and `cyberbattle/__init__.py` files.

### 3. **AI-Powered Scene Generation for Industrial Digitalization Cybersecurity Simulation**

#### **Feature Overview**

SpiderSim integrates **LLMs** to automate the creation of complex industrial digitalization cybersecurity simulation scenarios, significantly simplifying the process of scenario building.

#### **Documentation**

Here are the steps to generate AI-driven industrial digitalization scenarios, using the **Smart Ocean** scenario as an example:

1. **Prepare the Scene Description**
   Edit the file `AI_Scene_Code_Generate/data.txt` to include detailed information about the Smart Ocean scenario. This file serves as the input for scene generation.

   Notice: If the topology of additional scenarios needs to be generated, please ensure that the corresponding scene details are included or modified accordingly. You can refer to the format in the `Industrial_Digitalization_Scenario_Library` files for consistency.

2. **Run AI Scene Generation**
   The AI generation code is located in the `AI_Scene_Code_Generate` directory. Configure API keys for the LLM in the `main.py` file or via environment variables, then run:

   ```
   python SpiderSim/AI_Scene_Code_Generate/main.py
   ```

   The generated scene topology will be saved in the `AI_Code/` directory as `AI_Code.json`.

3. **Validate the Generated Scene**
   The following code will read the content of the `AI_Code.json` file and construct the topology of the scene:

   ```
   python cyberbattle/samples/AI_Scene/scene.py
   ```

4. **Instantiate the Gym Environment**
   You can refer to the ‚ÄúInstantiate the Gym Environment‚Äù section in *Evaluating the Effectiveness of Deception-Based Cyber Defense* for a detailed guide on how to instantiate the environment.

   This guide provides step-by-step instructions and code examples to help you set up the Gym environment in your project.

#### **Note**

AI-generated code may contain errors. It is recommended to manually inspect and correct the generated code before integrating it into your project. Alternatively, modify the `scene.py` script to handle generated code manually.
