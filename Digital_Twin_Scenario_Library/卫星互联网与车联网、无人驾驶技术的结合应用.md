### Combined application of Satellite Internet, Internet of vehicles and driverless Technology

#### 1. Domain Background

With the continuous development of satellite internet, traditional flat networks are gradually transforming into three-dimensional networks, offering wide coverage and high-speed broadband connectivity. The integration of satellite internet into smart transportation, particularly with vehicular networks (V2X) and autonomous driving technologies, is garnering significant attention. Through satellite internet, vehicles, roads, and traffic infrastructure can be seamlessly connected, providing enormous potential for the popularization and development of intelligent transportation systems. In the future, satellite internet will open up broader application scenarios for vehicular networks and autonomous driving technologies, promoting the smart upgrade of traffic management and self-driving solutions.

#### 2. Problem Analysis

Vehicular networks and autonomous driving technologies have high communication demands, particularly in terms of real-time data transmission and low latency. Traditional terrestrial communication networks often struggle to provide stable coverage in environments such as highways, remote areas, and aerial traffic. Satellite internet, as an all-encompassing communication tool, can provide support in these areas, but challenges remain in ensuring real-time communication, low latency, and security for large-scale vehicles and devices. The integration of satellite internet with vehicular networks and autonomous driving technologies faces issues such as efficiently and reliably transmitting vast amounts of data while ensuring traffic safety and service quality.

#### 3. Scene Introduction

To combine satellite internet with vehicular networks and autonomous driving technologies, satellite communication terminals need to be deployed along highways, urban roads, and remote areas to provide real-time, efficient communication support for vehicles. Satellite internet not only offers a broadly covered communication network but also supports high-speed data transmission, ensuring that autonomous vehicles can make real-time decisions and coordinate in various environments. For example, in a fleet of autonomous vehicles, satellite internet will ensure efficient information exchange between vehicles and between vehicles and road infrastructure, facilitating coordinated control and safety assurance for autonomous driving.

#### 4. Scene Target

The goal of integrating satellite internet with vehicular networks and autonomous driving technologies is to enhance the intelligence of traffic systems, optimize traffic management, and improve safety. With satellite internet, vehicles can continuously access road information, real-time traffic conditions, and autonomous driving instructions, thereby reducing traffic congestion and improving road throughput. At the same time, autonomous driving systems can rely on satellite internet for more accurate positioning, navigation, and decision-making, further promoting the widespread adoption and development of self-driving technologies.

#### 5. Scenario Elements

The system design includes satellite communication systems, vehicular network terminals, autonomous driving technology modules, data transmission platforms, and security layers. The satellite communication system will provide reliable signal transmission for vehicles and traffic infrastructure globally, while the vehicular network terminals facilitate information exchange between vehicles and roads. The autonomous driving technology modules support self-driving decision-making and control, and the data transmission platform handles the massive data generated by vehicular networks, ensuring low-latency transmission. The security layer ensures the safety and privacy of the entire system, protecting against network attacks and data leaks during autonomous driving operations.
